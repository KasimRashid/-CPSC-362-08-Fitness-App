Tien (Eric)'s project diary:
1. Saturday, September 12: Create the C++ file and test the ability to add activities, after a long discussion and ideas about how it should be. Try to put out on the screen the activities.
On this day, I also chose 5 different activities that are "common" and have different k values.

2. Monday, September 15: Write about the input of hours and validate the input (hour (in minutes)) to be an integer, write a try-catch block to handle some exceptions.
Limit the minutes from 0 to 1440. 
Did have an idea about the loop for retype in the values if the typed-in value did not match the requirements.
Discussed the tasks mentioned in class.

3. Tuesday, September 16: Write the 1st idea about how the rewardPoint function should be. Thinking and trying about the rounding of the rewarded points. 
Noted the ideas about ranking the points.

4. Write the 1st draft about the pages and tasks that need to be done for the project.
Finishing the ideas about the points, rounded points, and adding points to the original point system of the user.
Noted and think about the possibility of typing in many activities at the same time//need further discussion with the team.
