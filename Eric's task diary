Tien (Eric)'s project diary:
1. Saturday, September 12: Create the C++ file and test the ability to add activities, after a long discussion and ideas about how it should be. Try to put out on the screen the activities.
On this day, I also chose 5 different activities that are "common" and have different k values.

2. Monday, September 15: Write about the input of hours and validate the input (hour (in minutes)) to be an integer, write a try-catch block to handle some exceptions.
Limit the minutes from 0 to 1440. 
Did have an idea about the loop for retype in the values if the typed-in value did not match the requirements. 
[Done September 17, for decision (type in more than one activity at a time), re-type invalid weight, minutes] 
Discussed the tasks mentioned in class.

3. Tuesday, September 16: Write the 1st idea about how the rewardPoint function should be. Thinking and trying about the rounding of the rewarded points. 
Noted the ideas about ranking the points.

4. Wednesday, September 17: 
Write the 1st draft about the pages and tasks that need to be done for the project.
Finishing the ideas about the points, rounded points, and adding points to the original point system of the user. 
Divide points into original points, rewarded points, and new total points.
Write the do-while loop for the input of weight and hours (in minutes):  do-while when the type-in value is correct, but out of range, and the type-in value is not in a correct form. 
Fixed the rounding problem when the user typed in float-type values of weight and minutes.

Noted, but not yet being specified, fixed the type-in decision that the user typed more achievements or not, but it works properly :D.
Noted and think about the possibility of typing in many activities at the same time  //need further discussion with the team about the UI. 
Think about the ideas of the limitation of points per date to reduce abuse of the system and reduce the negative health impact of overworking.
Think about the ideas that there's a reward point for a continuous day of work out/activities //need to discuss further.

---The need to download the "git" kit for easier downloading of project content.
